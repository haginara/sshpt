"""
SSH Power Tool (SSHPT): This program will attempt to login via SSH to a list of servers supplied in a text file (one host per line).  It supports multithreading and will perform simultaneous connection attempts to save time (10 by default).  Results are output to stdout in CSV format and optionally, to an outfile (-o).
If no username and/or password are provided as command line arguments or via a credentials file the program will prompt for the username and password to use in the connection attempts.
This program is meant for situations where shared keys are not an option.  If all your hosts are configured with shared keys for passwordless logins you don't need the SSH Power Tool.
